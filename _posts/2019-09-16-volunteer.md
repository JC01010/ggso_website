Calling all prospective volunteers!

Student organizations from Stanford University and UC Berkeley are joining forces to co-host the fourth annual Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational tournament! This competition will be hosting over 50 teams from across the country, and we need qualified test writers, proctors, general volunteers, and event supervisors to join us! The tournament will be on Saturday, February 22, 2020 at the campus of UC Berkeley. Sign up via these registration forms by their respective deadlines if you are interested in being an event supervisor, joining the test committee, or recruiting as a general volunteer, and weâ€™ll reach out to you personally within a few weeks with more information.
