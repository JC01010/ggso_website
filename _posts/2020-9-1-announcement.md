# 2021 Tournament Announcement

Hello GGSO Community,

We’re excited to announce that the 2021 GGSO Invitational will be taking place on Saturday, February 13th, 2021! The tournament will follow the MiniSO model, which allows students to participate from their own homes. After a detailed consideration of participant feedback and NSO guidelines, we’ve concluded that this format is the most practical and safe for this year.

Important highlights include:

- Official team registration opens on Scilympiad on Monday, October 5th at Noon PDT on a first-come first-served basis at <a href = "https://statescioly.org/golden-gate">this</a> link. The registration fee will be $50, due by November 20, 2020. Please contact us if the registration fee poses a challenge for your team. 

- The tournament will have a maximum of 100 competing teams, and a maximum of 2 teams allowed per school.

- We will be holding all Division C events allowed in the MiniSO model following regional-level rules. All tests will be administered in a synchronous form according to the PDT time zone. Students residing in other time zones are also welcome to participate, but will need to adhere to these times. 

- Events will be held on the Scilympiad platform, which allows partners to work simultaneously on tests. We also encourage partners to work together through other virtual platforms (ex. Phone call, video conferencing, etc.) but teams will not be allowed to gather in-person. 

Details for team registration, who to mail checks to, and general information regarding how the tournament will operate can be found <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PgulkUgZ8pOl2daWdRuLzUSWo5lmfeKH7uJjoBNgBtk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
