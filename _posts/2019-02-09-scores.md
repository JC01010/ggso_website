# Final Results

Final results can be found [here.](/doc/results_2019.pdf) Scores are considered final, so teams may not file an appeal/challenge scores. Tests/key distribution will occur within the next week (stay tuned for a future email!) Wright Stuff rubrics will be emailed out with the tests/keys. Photos will be posted within the next two weeks.

Thank you to all the teams that came out to compete today and congrats to all!
