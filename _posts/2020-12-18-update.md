# December Updates

Hello GGSO community,

I hope you all have been doing well! With the tournament coming up, we would like to provide you with several tournament updates and reminders.

<b>Event Schedule:</b> This year, we will not be having event sign-ups; each event already has an allotted time slot and the schedule can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhhFDybp2RPfqP_s_4udwhTCQWXFlkmDZoc5O-3EYFg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<b>Awards Ceremony:</b> Due to concerns about time to grade tests, we have also moved our awards ceremony to <b>Saturday, February 20, 2021</b> in the evening (one week after the tournament).

<b>Write It, CAD It:</b> In addition, the software that we will be using for Write It, CAD It is <b>Onshape</b>. Teams will need to make their own accounts using the student version, which is free. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mO0YaPh-shvcu6__tcI2rao-bZNPwDqEnX4w9iph3qY/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> are instructions on how to set up an account and a more detailed event description. 

<b>Student Rosters/Release Forms:</b>Please complete the students roster and the release forms on Scilympiad as soon as possible. Students will not be able to participate in the tournament without them. 

<b>T-shirt Contest:</b> Finally, our T-shirt design competition will end on <b>December 31, 2020</b>. Please submit your design to <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQvC6DbqXGdXuNifkWHoFEslZdhz9uhTNuBdC7hAIf9omiKQ/viewform">this</a> form; the winner of the contest will receive a free GGSO t-shirt!

We will continue to update our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PgulkUgZ8pOl2daWdRuLzUSWo5lmfeKH7uJjoBNgBtk/edit">detailed plan</a> as the season goes.
