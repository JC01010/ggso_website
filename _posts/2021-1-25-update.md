# January Updates

Hello GGSO community,

I hope you all have been doing well! With the tournament right around the corner, we would like to provide you with several tournament updates and reminders.

<b>Team Numbers:</b> We have assigned team numbers on <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15S0l71y05jJcq5jR_tgCBhPnlH0wrfs-f_nUiTHpQqs/edit?usp=sharing">this</a> sheet and you should now be able to assign competitors to teams and events on Scilympiad. Please note that student rosters and release forms are due before competition day on <b>February 13, 2021</b>; students will not be able to compete without having these completed.

<b>T-shirt Contest:</b> Congratulations to Jackie Chiang from Milpitas High School for winning our T-shirt design competition! We had many stand-out submissions that were entered, so thank you to all those who submitted their amazing designs! GGSO T-shirts with her design are now on sale! T-shirts are $16 dollars each and you can order them directly on CustomInk <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cd-6nfk">here</a>. Orders may be placed through Sunday of competition weekend on <b>February 13th, 2021</b> and will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk two weeks after, in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.

<b>Event Schedule:</b> Just as a reminder, this year we will not be having event self sign-ups. Each event already has a designated time slot and the schedule can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhhFDybp2RPfqP_s_4udwhTCQWXFlkmDZoc5O-3EYFg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<b>Write It, CAD It:</b> The software that we will be using for Write It, CAD It is <b>Onshape</b>. Teams will need to make their own accounts using the student version, which is free. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mO0YaPh-shvcu6__tcI2rao-bZNPwDqEnX4w9iph3qY/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> are instructions on how to set up an Onshape account and a more detailed event description. After setting up your account, coaches should make sure to individually assign their Writers and CAD-ers for the Write It, CAD It events. There are two events set up for it on Scilympiad, one for each partner, so one student should be assigned to each role.

<b>Academic Integrity:</b> Ensuring the academic integrity of our tournament is of utmost importance. For this reason, we are requiring students to <b>upload a PDF copy</b> of their cheat sheet(s) online through Google Forms <B>before the start of the corresponding event block.</b> This form will be released at a later time. This only applies to events with a limited number of cheat sheets (binders do not need to be submitted). Students will be able to have their own copy of their cheat sheets/binders for each event provided that each studentâ€™s copy is identical. Students will be allowed to view cheat sheets and binders on an electronic device, but students will <b>NOT</b> be allowed to use any other resources not outlined in the official rules.

We will continue to update our detailed <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PgulkUgZ8pOl2daWdRuLzUSWo5lmfeKH7uJjoBNgBtk/edit">plan</a>, where you will find the most up-to-date information.

Best wishes, <br/>
The GGSO Team
