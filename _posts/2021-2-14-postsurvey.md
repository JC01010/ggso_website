# Post-Tournament Recap

Hello GGSO community,

We were so pleased to have you join us for the fifth annual (and first virtual!) GGSO tournament this past weekend, and we want to offer a huge congratulations to all our coaches, competitors, and volunteers! 

<b>Feedback:</b> Now that the tournament is over, weâ€™d like to collect your thoughts about how it went: good, bad, annoying, wonderful. We ask that at least one coach and one student from each participating team fills out the feedback survey <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/oZKWBokDJ7yx7mE6A">here</a>. When at least one student and one coach have completed this form, a folder with the tests and score distributions will be shared with the team. We would really appreciate the chance to hear your thoughts in order to improve the experience, which we hope can be held in person next year.

<b>Events:</b> Write It Cad It <b>has become a trial event</b> for this GGSO invitational tournament and its results will not be counted toward the team total. Updates on other events, if any, will come in the following days.

<b>T-shirts:</b> T-shirts are still on sale! The order deadline has been extended through <b>11:59 PM PST on Sunday, February 14th</b>. T-shirts are $16 dollars each and you can order them directly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cd-6nfk">here</a>. Orders will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk two weeks after, in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.

Once again, we are extremely sorry for all the inconveniences that Scilympiad caused and we appreciate you being patient with us. We thank you and congratulate you on your achievements in STEM and Science Olympiad, and we hope you will consider joining us again next year!

If you have any questions, feel free to email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com!

Best wishes, <br/>
The GGSO Team
