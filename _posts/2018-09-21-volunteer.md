	<br>Calling all Science Olympiad alumni!
	<br>
	<br>Student organizations from Berkeley and Stanford are joining forces to co-host the third annual Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament! This competition will be hosting over 1,000 students and staff from across the country, and we need qualified test writers, proctors, general volunteers and event supervisors to join us! Our numerous volunteers have always been essential to the success of the tournament. The tournament will be on **February 29th, 2018** at UC Berkeley. Sign up via these registration forms by **Friday, October 5th at 11:59 PM** if you are interested in helping and weâ€™ll reach out to you personally within a few weeks with more information. Please tag anyone you know who would be interested in the comments!
