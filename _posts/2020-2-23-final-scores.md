# Final Scores

Final results can be found [here](https://unosmium.org/results/2020-02-22_golden_gate_invitational_c). Scores are considered final, so teams may not file an appeal/challenge scores. Since all tests/rubrics were returned to each school, we are unable to process any score appeals/fix any score errors. 

Tests/keys will be distributed to teams (who attended) within the next few days - stay tuned for a future email! Score distributions will be released within the next week and photos will be posted within the next two weeks. Tests and answer keys will be publicly released in one month (Saturday 3/22/20).
