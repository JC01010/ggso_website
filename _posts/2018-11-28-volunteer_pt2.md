Calling all volunteers!

On February 9th, 2019, high school students from across the nation will arrive at UC Berkeley for the third Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational. This tournament is co-hosted by Science Olympiad alumni from Stanford and Cal, and will feature over 700 high school students competing in each of the 23 official events.

We need student volunteers from both Stanford and Berkeley to help this tournament be a success! For the majority of general volunteers, no Science Olympiad experience is necessary to help set up, administer, and judge events. Please fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/wxFwbq4zYEBJny743) to indicate any interest in helping put on this incredible tournament! 

Transportation will be provided or reimbursed for volunteers coming from the Bay Area, but costs will not be covered for those coming from farther distances.

Please contact us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com or check us out at goldengateso.com if you have any questions! Note that this form is NOT an absolute commitment.

**This form will be due on Dec. 5, 2018 at 11:59pm**
