# Hey There!

Welcome to our new website for the inaugural Golden Gate Science Olympiad Tournament! Take a moment to hear about our preliminary plans on the “About” page, and get to know us on the “Our Team” page. Although currently scattered around the world, we’ve spent our summer planning for the upcoming Division C tournament, and we just want to highlight a few features that we’re really excited about:

* First, we intend to have **all** events run by past national medalists or event supervisors.

* We’ll review every test to ensure a quality competition, and give coaches the freedom to watch their teams compete. 

* We’re also looking forward to showing competitors our beautiful campus and the spirit of Silicon Valley that permeates academics, extracurriculars, and social events here at Stanford and UC Berkeley.

* Finally, we’re working hard to prepare a well-organized tournament: following the national schedule, bringing in admissions representatives, and inviting corporate sponsors.

We look forward to meeting competitors from across the state and the nation, so please stay tuned for more announcements regarding the release of registration in September!
