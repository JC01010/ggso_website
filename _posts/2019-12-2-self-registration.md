# Self Registration


Welcome coaches! [This guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16XgD4PrkHGkwtAloLoZpdZrFdYwSuJG3T8CZnnD-m5g/edit?usp=sharing) an instructional guide to self-schedule your team’s events. Self-schedules will open at **12:00 PM PT on December 10, 2019.** If you have questions about the self-schedule process or are experiencing any difficulty, please email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com. 

**Team Numbers**

Team numbers can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18EzTQeIsobi_cl85j--G3x0rDnNxKEEBnLlmAKb27uM/edit#gid=2043171544).

**Food/Drink Policy for the Gym**

As an update to our previous guidelines email, no food/drink will be allowed in the RSF fieldhouse, meaning that the rules will follow the standard food policy below: 

Berkeley does not allow food in reserved rooms. Please DO NOT throw your trash away in the rooms. If food or food trash is found in the event rooms, UC Berkeley will fine you up to $5,000. 
Teams with food in their homerooms and trash cans face possible point deductions on their score and blacklisting from future GGSO events. We deeply apologize for this inconvenience but hope that it’s not too troublesome. You are, however, allowed to have food anywhere outside!

The full policy regarding food/drink can be found [here](https://goldengateso.com/tournament-guidelines/). As a reminder, Gravity Vehicle and Wright Stuff will be hosted in this space.
