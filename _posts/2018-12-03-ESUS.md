# Self-scheduled events

Welcome coaches! This is an instructional guide to self-schedule your team’s events. Self-schedules will open at 12:00 PM PT on December 10, 2018. If you have questions about the self-schedule process, please email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com.

1. To begin, please log in to [https://statescioly.org/golden-gate](https://statescioly.org/golden-gate)

2. At the top of the screen, find the “Coaches” tab. Click on this and find Head Coach Dashboard in the drop-down menu. The resulting page should look like this.

4. Note that the following events are self-schedule: Boomilever, Disease Detectives, Experimental Design, Mission Possible, Mousetrap Vehicle, Sounds of Music, Thermodynamics, and Wright Stuff. You can view our tentative events schedule here.

5. To sign your team up for an event, please click on the appropriate event block on the left-hand side of the column. Before 12:00 PM on December 10, every box in this column simply says “Blocked.” Make sure you have pop-ups enabled in your browser!

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign your team up, and double check that you selected the appropriate event and timeblock.

7. To view your event sign-ups, click “Show all my signups” (above the event timeblock table and to the left).

As always, feel free to send us an email at goldengatescioly@gmail.com if you are experiencing difficulty with self-scheduling events.
