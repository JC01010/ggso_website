# Registration Announcement and Tournament Policies
<br>

The registration form will be available [here](https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eCZQRbU9cJgiDzL). Please read below for more information.

Welcome!

The Golden Gate Science Olympiad invitational is thrilled to open registration on **September 27th at 12:00pm PDT (noon)** for Division C tournament to be hosted **January 27th, 2018** at the UC Berkeley campus! Please review our tournament policies before registering. Only team coaches will be allowed to register their teams.

Please note in your preparations that we anticipate significant demand and predict that spaces may fill quickly on a first-come, first-serve basis. Any school may choose to register 1 or 2 teams. We will confirm placement via email for the first **40 teams** and keep a waitlist beyond that. It is possible that up to an additional 5 openings may be offered to teams on the waitlist, pending space constraints to be resolved shortly.

Registration will be performed via an online form. The link placed on the home page of goldengateso.com will open up at 12:00 pm (noon). The first **40 teams** to register, ranked via time of submission, will receive a confirmation email within two days and an invitation to submit the registration fee. Upon receipt of the registration check, teams will receive a second confirmation email and will be added to the published list of attendees on the website. If Golden Gate SciOly does not receive your payment by **November 1st** and no other arrangements are made, the spot will be opened to teams on the waitlist (please email us directly if this timeline presents an inconvenience).

Please note that, due to high demand, middle schools (B division) will not be allowed to register for this tournament.

The team registration fee is $150, and should be paid via check made out to “Golden Gate SciOly” and mailed to:
<center>
Golden Gate Scioly<br>

PO Box 1402<br>

Palo, Alto CA 94302
</center>

The registration fee is nonrefundable, except at the discretion of the tournament coordinators or in the unforeseen event of tournament cancellation. Receipts will be included in coaches’ packets to be distributed the day of competition. (Any requests for receipts to be mailed earlier should be made to [goldengatescioly@gmail.com](mailto:goldengatescioly@gmail.com).)

The Golden Gate Invitational may also feature custom t-shirts for sale to competitors! Teams may pre-order t-shirts using a separate t-shirt form available after registration.

Other documents, including waivers and liability releases, will be distributed to participating teams shortly after registration. Further tournament details, including the schedule and logistics, are on their way as well!

Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns at [goldengatescioly@gmail.com](mailto:goldengatescioly@gmail.com). We’re so excited to welcome you to our campus!
