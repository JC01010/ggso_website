# Waivers

Hello again from the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Team! We wish you a Happy New Year and hope that your holidays were splendid. This email contains important reminders about waiver uploads, which are due by no later than **January 18th**. If you have already uploaded waivers, we thank you. If you would like to confirm, please reach out via email.

**Every attending minor must fill out two forms prior to the tournament.** The first form is a liability waiver that can be found **[here](https://tinyurl.com/ggso-activity-waiver)**. The second form is a media authorization that can be found **[here](https://tinyurl.com/ggso-media-waiver)** and should be printed and distributed to all minors (including competing students, alternates, and siblings that choose to attend as spectators) . 

**We are asking that coaches then scan the stack of forms and upload the file to a Google Drive folder ([https://tinyurl.com/waiver-upload](https://tinyurl.com/waiver-upload)) that is private and only available to GGSO team coordinators (by turning off "view by link" in share settings)**.  Each coach should create a folder with their school name and put the scanned pdf files in this folder. If schools have two teams, please make a folder for each team, with the team number clearly displayed. The forms may be submitted as a single pdf file or several, but a single is preferred. We will not require any paper copies to be submitted. If you haven’t worked with Google Drive before, consider asking a tech-savvy student to help you out! If you’re still having trouble, please reach out to us ASAP. **Scans must be done on a scanner or a cell phone scanner app.**

If you are having trouble uploading the forms into Google Drive, **you may also submit forms through the Google Form located here: [https://bit.ly/2snOzXL](https://bit.ly/2snOzXL)**. Please do let us know if you have any further questions! We are happy to help.
