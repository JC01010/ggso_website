# Registration

Welcome!

The Golden Gate Science Olympiad invitational is thrilled to open registration on **September 20th at 12:00pm PDT** (noon) for the inaugural Division C tournament to be hosted February 11th, 2017 at the UC Berkeley campus! Please review our [tournament policies](/details/) before registering. Only team coaches will be allowed to register their teams.

Please note in your preparations that we anticipate significant demand, and predict that spaces may fill quickly on a first-come, first-serve basis. **Only the first 12 schools to register two teams will reserve a place for both teams**, while later schools may register **one** team (more information on this is specified below). We will confirm placement via email for the first 45 teams and keep a waitlist beyond that. It is likely that up to an additional 5 openings may be offered to teams on the waitlist, pending space constraints to be resolved shortly.

Registration will be performed via a Google form. The link will be placed on the home page of goldengateso.com at 12:00 pm (noon). The first 45 teams to register, ranked via time of submission, will receive a confirmation email within two days and an invitation to submit the registration fee. Upon receipt of the registration check, teams will receive a second confirmation email and will be added to the published list of attendees on the website. If Golden Gate SciOly does not receive your payment **by October 18th** and no other arrangements are made, the spot will be opened to teams on the waitlist (please email us directly if this timeline presents an inconvenience).

In order to allow more schools to participate, only the first **12 schools to register two teams** will be guaranteed a reserved spot for both teams. Schools which register later may still register two teams, but **only one spot will be reserved**.  The second team will be placed on a waitlist. If, by October 19th, the 45 spots are not filled, teams on the waitlist will be contacted to confirm their reservation. Each team must be supervised by one adult/coach (schools wishing to bring two teams should be prepared to list two adult coaches on the registration form).

Please note that, due to high demand, middle schools (B division) will **not** be allowed to register for this tournament.

The team registration fee is $150, and should be paid via check made out to “Golden Gate SciOly” and mailed to:

<p align="center">
531 Lasuen Ave<br>
P.O. Box 13500<br>
Stanford, CA 94309
</p>

The registration fee is nonrefundable, except at the discretion of the tournament coordinators or in the unforeseen event of tournament cancellation. Receipts will be included in coaches’ packets to be distributed the day of competition. (Any requests for receipts to be mailed earlier should be made to [goldengatescioly@gmail.com](mailto: goldengatescioly@gmail.com).)

The Golden Gate Invitational will also feature custom t-shirts for sale to competitors! Teams may pre-order t-shirts using a separate t-shirt form available around the time of registration. T-shirts will be available at a discounted price until December 1st  (further information to come). A limited quantity of additional shirts will also be sold the day of the tournament.

Other documents, including waivers and liability releases, will be distributed to participating teams shortly after registration. Further tournament details, including the schedule and logistics, are on their way as well!

Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns at [goldengatescioly@gmail.com](mailto: goldengatescioly@gmail.com). We’re so excited to welcome you to our campus!
