# Registration Announcement and Tournament Policies
<br>
	_**Update: Registration is now full. You may still sign up [here](https://statescioly.org/golden-gate) to be placed on the waitlist.**_
	<br>
	<br>Hello from Golden Gate Science Olympiad! Every year we host a Science Olympiad invitational and this year it will be held on **February 9th, 2019** at the **University of California, Berkeley**. Take a moment to visit our website [here](https://goldengateso.com/). Our team is comprised of Science Olympiad alumni at UC Berkeley and Stanford University. Our goal is to continue to run a competitive, fun tournament based on our collective experience in competing, event supervision, and tournament logistics. Last year, we welcomed a total of 50 teams, results can be found [here](https://goldengateso.com/doc/results.pdf), from as far as Hawaii and Pennsylvania. Invitational trips are a great way to boost team bonding, get students excited about competition, and encourage the team to get started early in their preparations. If you have any interest or questions about the Golden Gate Invitational tournament, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out via email! We highly recommend making it out to our invitational for an unforgettable experience.
<br>
	<br>**Registration** for our tournament this year is different and can be found [here](https://statescioly.org/golden-gate). We are using a new platform Scilympiad, that encompases not only school registration and sign ups, but also awards results and so much more. Instructions for this new platform are as follows:
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. As a coach you will sign up and fill out the necessary contact information. 
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Once you have successfully logged in, navigate to coaches -> school registration and fill out your School Name, District, and Division
<br>
<br>**Registration fee** for this year will be the same, $150 per team registered. 
<br>**Registration time** for this year will be September 17th at 12:00 PM PST.
