# Registration Announcement and Tournament Policies
<br>
	<br>Hello from Golden Gate Science Olympiad! Every year we host a Science Olympiad invitational and this year it will be held on **February 9th, 2019** at the **University of California, Berkeley**. Take a moment to visit our website [here](https://goldengateso.com/). Our team is comprised of Science Olympiad alumni at UC Berkeley and Stanford University. Our goal is to continue to run a competitive, fun tournament based on our collective experience in competing, event supervision, and tournament logistics. Last year, we welcomed a total of 50 teams, results can be found [here](https://goldengateso.com/doc/results.pdf), from as far as Hawaii and Pennsylvania. Invitational trips are a great way to boost team bonding, get students excited about competition, and encourage the team to get started early in their preparations. If you have any interest or questions about the Golden Gate Invitational tournament, please don’t hesitate to reach out via email! We highly recommend making it out to our invitational for an unforgettable experience.
<br>
	<br>**Registration** for our tournament this year is different and can be found [here](https://statescioly.org/golden-gate). We are using a new platform Scilympiad, that encompases not only school registration and sign ups, but also awards results and so much more. Instructions for this new platform are as follows:
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. As a coach you will sign up and fill out the necessary contact information. 
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Once you have successfully logged in, navigate to coaches -> school registration and fill out your School Name, District, and Division
<br>
<br>**Registration fee** for this year will be the same, $150 per team registered. 
<br>**Registration time** for this year will be September 17th at 12:00 PM PST. 

<br>If you have any questions or concerns feel free to reach out to us via email at goldengatescioly@gmail.com

## Eligibility & Registration Policies
* Schools must be registered with their home state Science Olympiad organization (and must have paid all applicable state and national fees) prior to competing in the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament.

* Teams’ places in the tournament are reserved in the order that they submit the online registration form, provided that the registration fee (paid by check) is received by Golden Gate SciOly by November 1, 2018.  Teams whose payment is not received by November 1 will forfeit their place to a team on the waitlist.  Please contact us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com if meeting the payment deadline may pose a problem for your school.

* The Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament is a Division C competition.  All teams must conform to the Science Olympiad Division C membership rules.

* All students on each team must be eligible to compete for that team as per the eligibility rules specified on soinc.org.

* We reserve the right to cap registration at 40 teams and to close registration when 40 teams have registered.

* All participating students must fill out several waivers and liability releases, which will be distributed to participating teams shortly after registration.

## Competition Day Policies
* No team or team coach will be asked to write a test or supervise an event. All events will be run by Science Olympiad alumni, and all tests and answer keys will be made available to teams after the competition.

* On competition day, every team will be given access to a room or part of a room at UC Berkeley to serve as their homeroom/team base.

* Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational will make every attempt to adhere closely to the 2018 National Science Olympiad event schedule.

* Unless otherwise stated, the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will follow all rules as stated in the printed national rule book and national event clarifications posted here.  We will follow all rules and clarifications published by the National Science Olympiad organization.

* For events for which the printed national rule book specifies different rules or content for different levels of competition, the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will follow the rules specified for the regional tournament level.

* Each team must be accompanied to the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament by at least one unique adult.  (In other words, schools which send two teams to the Tournament must be accompanied by at least two adults on competition day.)
