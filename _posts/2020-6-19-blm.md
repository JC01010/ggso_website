# Supporting Black Students and Scientists

<center><img src="/img/announcements/BLM.png" height="100%" width="90%"/></center>

155 years ago from this day, federal orders were announced in Texas proclaiming that all slaves in the state were now free. On June 19th, 1865, the first ever Juneteenth took place, marking the emancipation of all slaves in the Confederacy.

Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, celebrating the freedom and autonomy of Black Americans. But the fight for justice is far from over. White supremacy, systemic racism, and institutional oppression continue to be tragically prominent realities of American life, and the unjustifiable killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, David McAtee, Mike Ramos, Tony McDade, and countless others at the hands of police brutality bring attention to the glaring racial injustices woven into our system at its core. The time for change is long overdue.

We at Golden Gate Science Olympiad are committed to broadening the horizons of STEM education across the nation's many communities and diverse backgrounds. But this cannot be achieved while inequity continues to permeate our nation's very structure and its governing institutions. It is our duty, as allies, to listen to, elevate, and empower Black voices and communities in any way that we can, and to be actively anti-racist in all that we do.

It would be complicit of us to disregard the severe lack of BIPOC representation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields within the United States. The realm of STEM education has a history of being an inaccessible and exclusionary space, undoubtedly playing its role in a broken system built to obstruct the mobility of BIPOC within this country. And there is no room for complacency in a broken system.
