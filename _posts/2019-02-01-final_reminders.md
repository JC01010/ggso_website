# Final Reminders

The Golden Gate Science Olympiad tournament is only eight days away, and we’re very excited to welcome you all to Berkeley’s campus. 

**Please read this post carefully**, as it contains critical updates on the tournament schedule and day-of logistics. Another email will be sent the night before the tournament as a reminder. Updates will also be posted on our website.

For any last-minute questions or concerns (Friday evening/during the day Saturday), the best person to contact is Faith. She can be reached at 701-595-4054.

**Food Regulation Reminder:** **NO FOOD IS ALLOWED IN HOMEROOMS.** We agree that this is a ridiculous and frustrating rule, but Berkeley’s Event Services has alerted us several times that custodians will be on patrol through our reserved areas. Similar student groups have faced **fines on the order of $5000** for violating this rule. We’re hoping for great weather on Saturday, so we recommend a nice lunch outside or encourage students to visit any of the many cafes highlighted in the maps on our website.

Please consider the homerooms as a place to study and store equipment, but not a place to eat. Custodians will be passing by rooms as well as checking trash cans. No food should be brought back to or disposed of in homerooms.

Unfortunately, we feel obligated to enforce this rule harshly, since a university violation would prevent future GGSO tournaments from being possible (and violating schools may share financial burden of any fines). Teams with food in their homerooms and trash cans face possible point deductions on their score and blacklisting from future GGSO events. We deeply apologize for this inconvenience but hope that it’s not too troublesome.

**Morning Check-in:** Please check in to receive your coach packet (which includes last-minute information, maps, and student wristbands). **Check-in will be run in Kerr Lobby, beginning at 8 a.m.**

**Campus Map:** We have an awesome digital map to aid in directions this year. Find it [here]( https://tinyurl.com/ggso19-map) or on our website under details. Please share this map with your teams as well. For additional navigation purposes, including walking to home rooms, events, and food locations, we recommend Google Maps. Previous tournament competitors have found this helpful.

**Wifi:** Free wifi is available on campus (connect to CalVisitor).

**Homerooms:** See [here](/doc/maps_2019.pdf) to check which homeroom your team has been assigned to--as well as the event locations. There are multiple tabs to the spreadsheet. These homerooms open by 8:15am.

**Car Parking and Food:** Please check for parking at any of the locations in the [parking map](/doc/parking_map.pdf). Note that some may require a daily fee. Food options we like can be found in [this document](/doc/food_options.pdf). Parking and food locations can also be found on our custom digital map.

**T-shirts [share with students]**: Last year there was huge demand for GGSO t-shirts that are otherwise reserved for volunteers. This year, we ordered some extra for competitors! A limited number of shirts will be available for $15 in Kerr Lobby during the tournament, beginning at 10 a.m. (cash or check only). 

**Awards ceremony:** The awards ceremony will open to teams at 5:30 p.m. in Pauley Ballroom. **Due to space constraints, chairs are reserved for competitors only.** A seating chart will be provided. The awards ceremony will conclude by 7:30 p.m., when coaches can then pick up tournament exams and score sheets from Tilden in MLK.

**Remind 101 service [share with students]:** We use this text message remind service to send out critical day-of updates aimed primarily at coaches, but we encourage any students and parents to sign up to stay updated as well. Phone numbers are kept completely confidential by the website service, we promise not to send any updates after the tournament, and you can opt out at any time. An email at a later date will include the information for Remind101 set-up for coaches and interested students and parents.

**Day and event schedule:** An event schedule can be found [here](/doc/event_schedule.pdf) and a general day schedule for the tournament has been posted online [here](/doc/day_schedule.pdf). 

**Phone number:** If any issues arise during check-in or during the tournament, please contact Faith at 701-595-4054.

**Social Media [Share with Students]:** We’re online! We’ll be posting fun tournament photos, updates, and live stories throughout the day to our Snapchat **[(ggscioly)](https://snapchat.com/add/ggscioly)** and Instagram **[(goldengatescioly)](https://www.instagram.com/goldengatescioly/)** accounts, as well as Twitter **[(@goldengateso)](https://twitter.com/goldengateso)**. Check us out!

Thank you for reading the update. As always, if you have any questions, please let us know!
