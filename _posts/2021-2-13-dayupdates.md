# Day Of Updates
We are sorry for all the inconveniences that Scilympiad has caused. As of now, we believe we have fixed the issue and would like to let you all know that you should do the following right now before students go on to take their next event:

Log out of Scilympiad and restart your browser to make sure that changes on Scilympiad are reflected.
Log back into your Scilympiad account and you may start your Block 2 events.
If that doesn’t work, try going to your browser’s history and resetting cookies and do step 2.

Since the block 1 events (Detector Building, Digital Structures, and Biophysics) had issues, we have created a new time block for the block 1 events **(from 4:10pm - 5:10pm PT)**. During this new time block, event supervisors will be present. If you can't do the block 1 events’ tests at this time, please **contact us and let us know which times during the day that you are available**, and we will grant students a time to take the test. If a school has more than one team, both teams must take the block 1 events at the same time in order to ensure fairness. Also, if you are unable to take the block 1 events at the 4:10pm - 5:10pm PT time block, we cannot guarantee that there will be event supervisors during the time that you take the tests at.

Moreover, we have extended the submission deadline for the team rosters, so if you need to make any last minute changes, you are free to do so.

If you are still facing problems or have any questions, please feel free to contact us with your team numbers and which events you are facing problems with.
