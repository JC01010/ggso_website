# Day Of Updates

## Update 5:
We thank you again for your patience as we deal with all of the issues associated with Write It CAD It. Due to all the issues that arose as a result of the Onshape crash this morning, we will be making Write It CAD It a trial event. The score will not factor into overall team placement, however, we will still be handing out medals for the event. Again, sorry for all the issues with this event.

## Update 4:
We thank you for your patience as we deal with all of the issues associated with Write It CAD It. It appears that Onshape crashed at the beginning of the CAD-er’s time slot, causing multiple teams to not have the full 20 minutes to complete the build. If this was the case for your team, please email the event supervisors (ixxia@stanford.edu and nicolexin@berkeley.edu), and we will grant extensions. For teams that need extensions, we will be manually opening the CAD-er event after 1 PM PST, after which the CAD-er will have a 20 minute time-block to continue their build, which they can start anytime during the day. **Please only use the amount of time you lost during the actual event** (i.e. if you were able to CAD for 10 minutes during the event, use only 10 minutes of the extension time). The CAD-er will have access to the writer’s instructions during that time.

To clarify, all teams that have reached out to us asking for extensions will be receiving an extension on the CAD-er’s end -- we just haven’t had the capacity to reply to every email. We have also had some issues with the writer’s instructions not saving -- unfortunately, this is a persistent issue with Scilympiad and we will not be able to grant exceptions.

## Update 3:
We apologize for all Write It CAD It issues. Our event supervisors will be reviewing all issues and time extension requests on a case by case basis. If your team were not able to upload files, please email Iris Xia (ixxia@stanford.edu) or Nicole Xin (nicolexin@berkeley.edu).

Additionally, some schools have reached out to us that one team has already taken a Block 1 event (Detector Building, Digital Structures, and Biophysics) but their other team was not able to take it yet. If a school has more than one team, both teams should take the block 1 events at the same time. If this is not possible, teams may take it at different times but will be held to higher scrutiny and additional review. The latest time that teams can take a test affected by a time extension/rescheduling is 6:00pm PT, please reach out to us if this is infeasible for your teams.

If you are still facing problems or have any questions, please feel free to contact us with your team numbers and which events you are facing problems with.


## Update 2:
Thank you for your patience as we have worked to resolve all the technical difficulties this morning. We have an update for the time slots for block 1 events.

Block 1 events (Detector Building, Digital Structures, and Biophysics) may be started at its designated rescheduled time block (from **4:10pm - 5:10pm PT**) or **at any time before 4:10pm**. Teams no longer need to email us to ask to take it earlier in the day. Please note that only during the rescheduled time block, event supervisors will be present, so we highly recommend that students take the exam during that block. In the case that competitors are unable to compete at that time block, they may take it at an earlier time (but the event supervisor will not be there). If a school has more than one team, both teams must take the block 1 events at the same time in order to ensure fairness (or else teams risk being disqualified). 

If you are still facing problems or have any questions, please feel free to contact us with your team numbers and which events you are facing problems with.

## Update 1:
We are sorry for all the inconveniences that Scilympiad has caused. As of now, we believe we have fixed the issue and would like to let you all know that you should do the following right now before students go on to take their next event:

Log out of Scilympiad and restart your browser to make sure that changes on Scilympiad are reflected.
Log back into your Scilympiad account and you may start your Block 2 events.
If that doesn’t work, try going to your browser’s history and resetting cookies and do step 2.

Since the block 1 events (Detector Building, Digital Structures, and Biophysics) had issues, we have created a new time block for the block 1 events **(from 4:10pm - 5:10pm PT)**. During this new time block, event supervisors will be present. If you can't do the block 1 events’ tests at this time, please **contact us and let us know which times during the day that you are available**, and we will grant students a time to take the test. If a school has more than one team, both teams must take the block 1 events at the same time in order to ensure fairness. Also, if you are unable to take the block 1 events at the 4:10pm - 5:10pm PT time block, we cannot guarantee that there will be event supervisors during the time that you take the tests at.

Moreover, we have extended the submission deadline for the team rosters, so if you need to make any last minute changes, you are free to do so.

If you are still facing problems or have any questions, please feel free to contact us with your team numbers and which events you are facing problems with.
