# Day Of Updates

## Update 3:
We apologize for all Write It CAD It issues. Our event supervisors will be reviewing all issues on a case by case basis. If your team were not able to upload files, please email Iris Xia(ixia@stanford.edu) or Nicole Xin (nicolexin@berkeley.edu).

## Update 2:
Thank you for your patience as we have worked to resolve all the technical difficulties this morning. We have an update for the time slots for block 1 events.

Block 1 events (Detector Building, Digital Structures, and Biophysics) may be started at its designated rescheduled time block (from **4:10pm - 5:10pm PT**) or **at any time before 4:10pm**. Teams no longer need to email us to ask to take it earlier in the day. Please note that only during the rescheduled time block, event supervisors will be present, so we highly recommend that students take the exam during that block. In the case that competitors are unable to compete at that time block, they may take it at an earlier time (but the event supervisor will not be there). If a school has more than one team, both teams must take the block 1 events at the same time in order to ensure fairness (or else teams risk being disqualified). 

If you are still facing problems or have any questions, please feel free to contact us with your team numbers and which events you are facing problems with.

## Update 1:
We are sorry for all the inconveniences that Scilympiad has caused. As of now, we believe we have fixed the issue and would like to let you all know that you should do the following right now before students go on to take their next event:

Log out of Scilympiad and restart your browser to make sure that changes on Scilympiad are reflected.
Log back into your Scilympiad account and you may start your Block 2 events.
If that doesn’t work, try going to your browser’s history and resetting cookies and do step 2.

Since the block 1 events (Detector Building, Digital Structures, and Biophysics) had issues, we have created a new time block for the block 1 events **(from 4:10pm - 5:10pm PT)**. During this new time block, event supervisors will be present. If you can't do the block 1 events’ tests at this time, please **contact us and let us know which times during the day that you are available**, and we will grant students a time to take the test. If a school has more than one team, both teams must take the block 1 events at the same time in order to ensure fairness. Also, if you are unable to take the block 1 events at the 4:10pm - 5:10pm PT time block, we cannot guarantee that there will be event supervisors during the time that you take the tests at.

Moreover, we have extended the submission deadline for the team rosters, so if you need to make any last minute changes, you are free to do so.

If you are still facing problems or have any questions, please feel free to contact us with your team numbers and which events you are facing problems with.
