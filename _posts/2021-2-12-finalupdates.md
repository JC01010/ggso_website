# Final Reminders

Hello GGSO community,

I hope you all have been doing well! The Golden Gate Science Olympiad tournament is tomorrow (Saturday 2/13), so here are some last reminders:

<b>Important Info:</b> All up-to-date information can be found on our GGSO 2021 Plan <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PgulkUgZ8pOl2daWdRuLzUSWo5lmfeKH7uJjoBNgBtk/edit">doc</a>.

<b>Scilympiad Action Items (Students):</b> Please ensure that all students have access to Scilympiad and can log in using their Login IDs <b>before the tournament tomorrow</b>. Any issues with login should be resolved before the tournament. Please note that students no longer have the option to use their email address to sign into Scilympiad; they must use their login IDs. Students must also turn in their waiver/release forms prior to tournament day (by <b>February 12, 11:59 pm PT</b>) in order to compete.

<b>Scilympiad Action Items (Coaches):</b> Student rosters should be finalized on Scilympiad by this same deadline (<b>February 12, 11:59 pm PT</b>). Coaches, remember that you must add students to teams and events on Scilympiad in order for students to take tests on tournament day. To clarify some questions we’ve received about our trial event, Biophysics, <b>teams are allowed to add alternates on Scilympiad and assign them to the event</b>. Details on how to do this, as well as other helpful tips, can be found in the Scilympiad Head Coach Reference Guide <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C89iAxOcoc6cH4OIqX9pm5p88cta7X6931HrJCgmOeY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<b>Time Zones:</b> Please note that all event schedules have times listed in Pacific Time. If your time zone is different, ensure that your students are aware of the respective time in your current time zone.

<b>Emergency Contact:</b> Should you have any urgent questions on the day of the tournament, coaches (no students) may join this zoom meeting (link <a target="_blank" href="https://stanford.zoom.us/j/93917725257?pwd=WmpCL1dOWkdzbzdxN1JFMHBMd1B1UT09">here</a>, password: 021321). The zoom will be open from <b>7:30 am - 4:30 pm PT</b>. Students and coaches can refer to our Day-of Tournament Troubleshooting guide (found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwFu7o9ulwN38wOhzgiJbcd3WqxK6dKm0yXTlSPJzYQ/edit?fbclid=IwAR1_L41ff1XKi-vKV7voq7AktFOgg0jxx70B5MyLgQWacAdy-P2j6xpWQ9g">here</a>) for common solutions to technical problems before contacting tournament directors. For any event-specific challenges/concerns, coaches can file an online appeal through Scilympiad as usual.

<b>Social Media:</b> Calling all students, teams, participants, and members of the GGSO community! Be sure to follow GGSO on all our social media platforms, so that you can stay up to date with the latest:<br>

We will be having a series of contests, challenges, and giveaways on the day of the tournament and throughout the following week! Keep up with our social media for further details, updates, and announcements — you won’t want to miss it!

<b>Notes Submission:</b> As mentioned previously, we have made a Google Form through which students will submit their note sheets before the event starts, which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/3MENf7XUx1spKtDt6">here</a>. Once again, this form is intended only for events with a limited number of note sheets; binder events do not require a submission. Please make <b>one</b> submission per team per event. If you update your notes, you should resubmit your note sheet to this form; we will only check the latest submission. All copies of the cheat sheets submitted will be deleted after the awards ceremony.

<b>Awards Ceremony:</b> Awards will be taking place on <b>February 20, 2021</b> at <b>5 pm PT</b>. The schedule is linked <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yu9vtbaEITvUqZculFzEZIy6IVRowMNpLhBmWEn2j20/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<b>Academic Integrity Guide:</b> We have also created an academic integrity guide for both students and coaches to read, found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-SrlxuggYGClG7R8Vz__0jYUTTMuQNCSHoSG7tRr14/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Please make sure to read it in its entirety as it details our investigation procedures in the event that we suspect cheating has occurred. <b>All communication with teams regarding academic integrity will be done through coaches</b>, so please be sure to monitor your email regularly and respond in a timely manner if we have any inquiries.

<b>T-shirt Sale:</b> GGSO T-shirts are now on sale! T-shirts are $16 dollars each and you can order them directly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cd-6nfk">here</a>. Orders may be placed through Sunday of competition weekend and will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk two weeks after, in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.

<b>Sponsors:</b> Finally, we would like to thank our sponsors for helping make this tournament possible: Stanford School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Chemical and Systems Biology at Stanford, and Professional Engineers in California Government.
