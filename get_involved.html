<h3>Golden Gate Science Olympiad would like to thank our past sponsors for bringing our dream of the tournament to reality:</h3>

<p><br />
<img class="sponsor" src="/img/sponsor/stanford_earth.png" /></p>
<p>The Stanford School of Earth, Energy &amp; Environmental Sciences develops the knowledge, talent and leadership to understand the changing Earth and to help solve the enormous resource and environmental challenges facing the world.</p>

<p><br />
<img class="sponsor" src="/img/sponsor/berkeley_bioengineering.png" /></p>
<p>Bioengineering applies engineering principles and practices to living things, to solve some of the most challenging problems that face our world today. The Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley seeks to define the new discipline of bioengineering by concentrating on cutting-edge research and the training of advanced undergraduate and graduate students to be the next leaders in the field. Consistently ranked in the Top 10 according to US News &amp; World Report, Bioengineering at Berkeley draws on the talents of a diverse group of outstanding faculty, and upon the long history of interdisciplinary bioengineering research at UC Berkeley. The department has programs at the undergraduate, professional master, and doctoral levels.</p>

<p><br />
<img class="sponsor_small" src="/img/sponsor/berkeley_ieor.png" /></p></br>
<p>The Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department at the University of California at Berkeley teaches students to invent, analyze and learn tools and approaches for design, analysis, risk management, and decision-making in complex real-world systems like supply chains, energy systems, healthcare systems, and financial systems.</p>

<p><br />
<img class="sponsor" src="/img/sponsor/llnl.gif" /></p>
<p>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has a mission of strengthening the United States’ security by developing and applying world-class science, technology and engineering that enhances the nation’s defense, reduces the global threat from terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and responds with vision, quality, integrity and technical excellence to scientific issues of national importance.</p>
<p><br />
<img class="sponsor" src="/img/sponsor/stanford_oso.png" /></p>

<p>Stanford’s Office of Science Outreach (OSO) encourages and assists Stanford faculty and students to engage in science outreach targeted at our nation’s youth, school teachers, and general public that will increase their interest, understanding, and involvement in science, math, and engineering. Reporting to Stanford’s Dean of Research, the OSO helps faculty and students create outreach project ideas and proposals with which to share their research. We identify potential partners (both within Stanford as well as K-14 schools, nonprofits, science museums, etc.), assist with proposal development and project implementation, and maintain the OSO website to advertise what’s on offer.</p>
<p><br />
<img class="sponsor" src="/img/sponsor/stanford_chemh.png" /></p></br>

<p>Stanford ChEM-H is a new interdisciplinary institute focused on connecting Chemistry, Engineering, and Medicine for Human Health. The institute is a joint venture of the Schools of Medicine, Engineering, and Humanities and Sciences. The proximity of world-class biologists, chemists, engineers, and clinicians at Stanford presents a unique opportunity to study human biology at a molecular level, to translate this knowledge into groundbreaking products and services that promote healthy living, and to educate a new cadre of “physician-scientist-engineers” who will lead a rapidly evolving industry.</p>
<p><br />
<p><img class="sponsor" src="/img/sponsor/avogadro.png" /></p></br>
<p>The Avogadro scoring system makes it painless to set up, host, score, and distribute results for Science Olympiad competitions.</p>
