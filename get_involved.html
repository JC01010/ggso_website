<h1>Volunteer</h1>
<p>The competition only runs smoothly because of the talent and hard work of our many, many volunteers throughout the process. Volunteering can be the fun, day-long adventure of assisting with a tournament event—time and test building events, or score and grade the written tests, and more—or the more-involved commitment of an events supervisor. As an events supervisor, you get the chance to write the test and/or be in the ‘room where it happens’ on the day of the event, influencing the way students will display the knowledge they have worked so hard to cultivate. Whatever volunteering commitment you decide is right for you, it is bound to happen that you will learn something: and lifelong learning and curiosity is something GGSO certainly supports.
Applications open in the fall and close on <strong>October 5, 2018 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time.</strong>

<h1>Executive Board</h1>
<p>Looking for an additional leadership role and more teamwork and involvement yet? Being part of the executive board for the GGSO Team puts you right in the center of the planning. With roles as diverse as Finance and Communications, Special Projects to Sponsorship, there is a place for a wide variety of personal experiences. If you have participated in Science Olympiad in the past and thought you might not get the chance to play an important role after high school graduation, being part of the Executive Board is a great way to involve yourself further and make a difference in how tournaments are designed and run.</p>
<p>Applications will open in the spring.

<h1>Donate to GGSO!</h1>
<p>The Golden Gate Science Olympiad is a major tournament for the region and the country—donations are how we are able to offer a quality competition for approximately fifty teams from schools not just in California, but around the country. Since GGSO is run by students, for students, we greatly appreciate any donations, whether financial or with regards to time (by volunteering with us!)</p>

<p>Bioengineering applies engineering principles and practices to living things, to solve some of the most challenging problems that face our world today. The Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley seeks to define the new discipline of bioengineering by concentrating on cutting-edge research and the training of advanced undergraduate and graduate students to be the next leaders in the field. Consistently ranked in the Top 10 according to US News &amp; World Report, Bioengineering at Berkeley draws on the talents of a diverse group of outstanding faculty, and upon the long history of interdisciplinary bioengineering research at UC Berkeley. The department has programs at the undergraduate, professional master, and doctoral levels.</p>

<p>Stanford’s Office of Science Outreach (OSO) encourages and assists Stanford faculty and students to engage in science outreach targeted at our nation’s youth, school teachers, and general public that will increase their interest, understanding, and involvement in science, math, and engineering. Reporting to Stanford’s Dean of Research, the OSO helps faculty and students create outreach project ideas and proposals with which to share their research. We identify potential partners (both within Stanford as well as K-14 schools, nonprofits, science museums, etc.), assist with proposal development and project implementation, and maintain the OSO website to advertise what’s on offer.</p>
