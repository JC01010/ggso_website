* A full list of registered teams and team numbers is available [here](/doc/registered_teams.pdf).

* The event schedule closely mirrors the Nationals schedule. A draft version is available [here](/doc/event_schedule.pdf) and the schedule for sign-up events is available [here](/doc/sign_up_schedule.pdf). Any changes will be announced via email to team coaches.

* An Evaluations Committee of eight Berkeley and Stanford students has been formed to review all exams prior to the tournament. They’ll be ensuring that every event at the invitational is of National quality, while still being approachable for new and inexperienced schools. Check out the “Our Team” tab above to meet the new members.

* Check back soon to meet the event supervisors!

<!-- * For registered teams, T-shirt preorders are available [here](https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a9jsaek2LcTg1SZ)! The design is available at the link, and shirts are $10 if ordered by early December. -->

# Competition Day Policies

* No team or team coach will be asked to write a test or supervise an event. All events will be run by Science Olympiad alumni, and all tests and answer keys will be made available to teams after the competition.

* On competition day, every team will be given access to a room or part of a room at UC Berkeley to serve as their homeroom/team base.

* Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational will make every attempt to adhere closely to the 2017 National Science Olympiad event schedule.

* Unless otherwise stated, the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will follow all rules as stated in the printed national rule book and national event clarifications posted here.  We will follow all rules and clarifications published by the National Science Olympiad organization.

* For events for which the printed national rule book specifies different rules or content for different levels of competition, the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will follow the rules specified for the regional tournament level.

* Each team must be accompanied to the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament by at least one unique adult.  (In other words, schools which send two teams to the Tournament must be accompanied by at least two adults on competition day.)

* Teams must abide by the Science Olympiad code of ethics and general rules specified on [soinc.org](https://www.soinc.org/)

* All built devices must conform to the general rules described on [soinc.org](https://www.soinc.org/).

* When applicable as stated in the printed rule book, students must wear appropriate eye protection as described on [soinc.org](https://www.soinc.org/).

* Teams (including students, parents, and coaches) may photograph or video-record their team participating at any of the openly viewable events. No team (including students, parents, and coaches) may record or photograph any other team’s engineering devices or competition runs. However, Golden Gate Science Olympiad will provide event photographers to capture images from throughout the tournament that will be made available to all participants.
