# Eligibility & Registration Policies

* Teamsâ€™ places in the tournament are reserved in the order that they submit online registration, provided that the registration fee is received by Golden Gate SciOly by November 1, 2018.  Teams whose payment is not received by November 1 will forfeit their place to a team on the waitlist.  Please contact us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com if meeting the payment deadline may pose a problem for your school.

* The Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament is a Division C competition.  All teams must conform to the Science Olympiad Division C membership rules. All students on each team must be eligible to compete for that team as per the eligibility rules specified on soinc.org.

* All participating students must fill out several waivers and liability releases, which will be distributed to participating teams shortly after registration. 

* Schools must be registered with their home state Science Olympiad organization (and must have paid all applicable state and national fees) prior to competing in the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament.

* On competition day, every team will be given access to a room or part of a room at UC Berkeley to serve as their homeroom/team base.

* Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational will make every attempt to adhere closely to the current year National Science Olympiad event schedule.

* Unless otherwise stated, the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will follow all rules as stated in the printed national rule book and national event clarifications posted here. We will follow all rules and clarifications published by the National Science Olympiad organization.
