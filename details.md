# Eligibility & Registration Policies

* Schools must be registered with their home state Science Olympiad organization (and must have paid all applicable state and national fees) prior to competing in the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament.

* Teams’ places in the tournament are reserved in the order that they submit the online registration form, provided that the registration fee (paid by check) is received by Golden Gate Science Olympiad by October 18, 2016.  Teams whose payment is not received by October 18 will forfeit their place to a team on the waitlist.  Please contact us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com if meeting the payment deadline may pose a problem for your school.

* Only the first 12 schools to register two teams will be guaranteed a reserved spot for both teams. Schools which register later may still register two teams, but only one spot will be reserved.  The second team will be placed on a waitlist.

* The Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament is a Division C competition.  All teams must conform to the Science Olympiad Division C membership rules.

* All students on each team must be eligible to compete for that team as per the eligibility rules specified on [soinc.org](https://www.soinc.org/).

* We reserve the right to cap registration at 45 teams and to close registration when 45 teams have registered.

* All participating students must fill out several waivers and liability releases, which will be distributed to participating teams shortly after registration.

# Competition Day Policies

* No team or team coach will be asked to write a test or supervise an event. All events will be run by Science Olympiad alumni, and all tests and answer keys will be made available to teams after the competition.

* On competition day, every team will be given access to a room or part of a room at UC Berkeley to serve as their homeroom/team base.

* Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational will make every attempt to adhere closely to the 2017 National Science Olympiad event schedule.

* Unless otherwise stated, the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will follow all rules as stated in the printed national rule book and national event clarifications posted here.  We will follow all rules and clarifications published by the National Science Olympiad organization.

* For events for which the printed national rule book specifies different rules or content for different levels of competition, the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will follow the rules specified for the regional tournament level.

* Each team must be accompanied to the Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament by at least one unique adult.  (In other words, schools which send two teams to the Tournament must be accompanied by at least two adults on competition day.)

* Teams must abide by the Science Olympiad code of ethics and general rules specified on [soinc.org](https://www.soinc.org/)

* All built devices must conform to the general rules described on [soinc.org](https://www.soinc.org/).

* When applicable as stated in the printed rule book, students must wear appropriate eye protection as described on [soinc.org](https://www.soinc.org/).

* Teams (including students, parents, and coaches) may photograph or video-record their team participating at any of the openly viewable events. No team (including students, parents, and coaches) may record or photograph any other team’s engineering devices or competition runs. However, Golden Gate Science Olympiad will provide event photographers to capture images from throughout the tournament that will be made available to all participants.
