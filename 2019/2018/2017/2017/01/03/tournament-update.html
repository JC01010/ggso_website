<p>Happy Holidays! Hopefully coaches have had a chance to read fully through our last update and to get started on some of those action items so that teams will be ready to compete on on February 11th! If you need to review these, you can find this first announcement below.</p>

<p>This week, we have just a couple short updates and a few reminders.</p>

<p><em>Event Schedule Change:</em> We’ve made a slight modification to the event schedule to more closely match the Nationals schedule. <em>Experimental design and disease detectives are now self sign up online.</em> The first five of the six blocks will be available (teams will not be able to sign up for the last block, 2:30 to 3:30, for these events).</p>

<p><em>Award Ceremony Time Clarification:</em> After conversations with National tournament directors and our peers at MIT, we’ve decided a more accurate start time for the Awards Ceremony is 5:30pm. These closing ceremonies are delayed at nearly every tournament, but it’s our goal to give you as accurate as possible of a forecast so that your team may enjoy touring the campus that afternoon instead of sitting in the ballroom and waiting through delays. This has been updated in the daily schedule posted to our website.</p>

<p><em>Event Supervisors:</em> Just a reminder that attending teams/coaches do not have to supervise or proctor any events! All events will be run by Science Olympiad alumni from Stanford, UC Berkeley, and the surrounding community. This makes it easy for coaches, and ensures competitors will enjoy high-quality exams and events.</p>

<p><em>Avogadro:</em> Some teams had trouble using the link to register for an Avogadro account. A better link is [https://app.avogadro.ws/register]. Please remember that you must register for an account and send us your username (see previous email for full instructions) prior to online event signups on <em>January 6th at noon.</em></p>

<p>Action Items Reminder: The following action item summary is copied from the previous update as a reminder:</p>
