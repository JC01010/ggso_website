  bio: Hey guys, I'm Celine, a Palo Alto High School Scioly alum and former team captain. I've competed in Scioly for the last five years (but how much does middle school count) with some of my best friends and it has been one of best experiences of my life. I’ve competed in GGSO since its debut (a whopping two years) and I can’t wait to get involved again this year!
  favEvents: Forensics, Materials Science, Protein Modeling
  funFact: I went straight from States to prom to a 6 am flight for a college visit, getting maybe 5 hours of sleep total over four days but I'd definitely relive it all again
