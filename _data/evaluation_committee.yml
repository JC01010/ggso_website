  bio: Hello, I'm Faith, a former six-year member of Science Olympiad and a captain of the Century High school team from Bismarck, North Dakota. What I learned in SciOly's never really left my life--love for science, skills and random facts alike. Sometimes knowing the Mohs scale of mineral hardness or the redshift effect of universe expansion proves useful!
  favEvents: Anatomy and Physiology, Astronomy, Rocks and Minerals, Dynamic Planet
  funFact: I write sci-fi and fantasy books in my free time!

  school: Computer Science, Berkeley 2019
  bio: Hello world, I’m Grant, former SciOly captain at Valencia High! My SciOly adventure began at Kraemer Middle, and I gradually found a passion for build events at Valencia High (competed 6 years). I still remember the long hours I spent soldering wires, gluing bridge joints with impossible precision, and getting wright stuff planes stuck in the ceiling. I have also helped coach the Kraemer team for 4 years and helped coordinate the CA Inland Empire Regionals and invitationals in the OC region. Overall, my SciOly experience has been a blast and I look forward to continuing to work with students in the community!
  favEvents: Robot Arm, Wright Stuff, and Bridge Building
  funFact: I love solving Rubik’s Cubes and writing/blogging!
