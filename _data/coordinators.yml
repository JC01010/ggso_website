  position: Tournament Director
  school: Human Biology, Stanford 2021
  bio: Hi!! I’m Evelyn, and I’m a Mira Loma Sci Oly alumni. I was only on the team since sophomore year, but those 3 years definitely shaped my passions and love for science. It was Science Olympiad that developed my interest in biology and led me to pursue a career in medicine. 
  favEvents: Anatomy and Physiology, Disease Detectives
  funFact: I actually didn’t want to do Disease Detectives until my sci oly coach put me on the event sophomore year, and by senior year I was 1st in the nation for the event. Lets just say that my coach made a good call :)
