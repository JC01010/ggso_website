  school: Bioengineering, Stanford 2019
  bio: Hi! I’m Alex! I competed in Science Olympiad for three years at Palo Alto High School, and while I don’t have a decreasing series of numbers as elegant as Ryan’s, I’ve experienced a variety of study/lab events at Regionals, States, and Nationals. Honestly I thought the 2015 season as one of Paly’s captains would be my last year involved with SciOly, like ever, but I guess I’m not getting away from this one! For anyone at Nationals in 2013, we were that dorky team that had dyed our hair (all of it) green.

  funFact: This picture is from States 2015 because my high school plans prom on the same day.
