  school: Computer Science, UT Austin 2020
  bio: Hello! I'm a LASA alum and was captain of LASA's Science Olympiad team during 2015 and 2016. I did build events, which means that most of my SciO memories involve soldering in a hotel room bathtub, getting gliders stuck in chandeliers, or getting kicked out of Wal-Mart at 1 AM (sometimes you gotta test Scrambler the night before...) Science Olympiad has been a pretty big part of my life (in both the good and bad ways), so I'm glad to be helping run this tournament.
