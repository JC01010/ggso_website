  school: Business Administration and Computer Science, Berkeley 2019
  bio: I’m a Mounds View Scioly Alumni, and I’ve been involved in Scioly all through high school. One time my team’s Scioly bus got stranded on a highway for 7 hours, making our trip to a tournament 21+ hours. That’s dedication.
  favEvents: Forensics, Fossils, Experimental Design
  funFact: I like heights because it scares me.

  school: Bioengineering, Stanford 2019
  bio: Hi! I’m Alex! I competed in Science Olympiad for three years at Palo Alto High School, and while I don’t have a decreasing series of numbers as elegant as Ryan’s, I’ve experienced a variety of study/lab events at Regionals, States, and Nationals. Honestly I thought the 2015 season as one of Paly’s captains would be my last year involved with SciOly, like ever, but I guess I’m not getting away from this one! For anyone at Nationals in 2013, we were that dorky team that had dyed our hair (all of it) green.

  bio: I've been involved with Science Olympiad at Mounds View since 2012. I have attended 3 nationals (captaining a team with Jon for one of them). My favorite events are It’s About Time, Technical Problem Solving and Compound Machines. Science Olympiad was by far my favorite thing that I did in High School and I hope our tournament will be a blast for everyone attending!

  bio: Hey, I’m Garrick, and I’m currently a sophomore at Stanford University interested in studying computer science, product design, or anything, really. In my spare time I jam on the ukelele, go on reddit, work as a theatre technician, and dabble in graphic design. I am excited to be working with the team at Golden Gate to inspire new generations of high school students to get excited about STEM!

- name: Neil Patil
  school: Computer Science, UT Austin 2020
  bio: Hello! I'm a LASA alum and was captain of LASA's Science Olympiad team during 2015 and 2016. I did build events, which means that most of my SciO memories involve soldering in a hotel room bathtub, getting gliders stuck in chandeliers, or getting kicked out of Wal-Mart at 1 AM (sometimes you gotta test Scrambler the night before...) SciO's been a pretty big part of my life (in both the good and bad ways), so I'm glad to be helping run this tournament and improve it for all of y'all.
  favEvents: Scrambler, Mission Possible
  funFact: When I wasn't doing SciO, I was programming. Some of you may remember LASACTF, something I co-created.

I’ve competed in Science Olympiad for 7 years, done build events for 6, gone to state for 5, coached a team for 4, proctored B division for 3, captained a team for 2, and supervised an A division event for 1 year. I’m from Mira Loma High School in Sacramento, where I’ve had the unparalleled pleasure of competing repeatedly and unwillingly in Mission Possible, as well as less-hellish events including Circuit Lab, MagLev, Compound Machines, and TPS. I also hold the incredible honor of once placing absolute dead last at Nationals. 60th place in Junkyard challenge, 2011. Shoutout to my coaches for never letting me forget it!
