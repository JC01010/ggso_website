  bio: Hey, I’m Garrick, and I’m currently a sophomore at Stanford University interested in studying computer science, product design, or anything, really. In my spare time I jam on the ukelele, go on reddit, work as a theatre technician, and dabble in graphic design. I am excited to be working with the team at Golden Gate to inspire new generations of high school students to get excited about STEM!

  bio: Hello! I'm a LASA alum and was captain of LASA's Science Olympiad team during 2015 and 2016. I did build events, which means that most of my SciO memories involve soldering in a hotel room bathtub, getting gliders stuck in chandeliers, or getting kicked out of Wal-Mart at 1 AM (sometimes you gotta test Scrambler the night before...) Science Olympiad has been a pretty big part of my life (in both the good and bad ways), so I'm glad to be helping run this tournament.
  favEvents: Scrambler, Mission Possible

  bio: Hello world, I’m Grant, former SciOly captain at Valencia High! My SciOly adventure began at Kraemer Middle, and I gradually found a passion for build events at Valencia High (competed 6 years). I still remember the long hours I spent soldering wires, gluing bridge joints with impossible precision, and getting wright stuff planes stuck in the ceiling. I have also helped coach the Kraemer team for 4 years and helped coordinate the CA Inland Empire Regionals and invitationals in the OC region. Overall, my SciOly experience has been a blast and I look forward to continuing to work with students in the community!

  bio: Hi, I’m Sarah Gurev, and I'm a Mira Loma and Churchill Scioly alum. I've had the opportunity to attend Nationals five times, and the distinct pleasure of competing in every single water event each time (Awesome Aquifers will always hold a special place in my heart). My favorite event, however, is Protein Modeling. Science Olympiad was such a large part of my life, so I'm grateful it's not quite over yet. I'm really excited to help bring this tournament to life!

  bio: Hi! Over the course of 6 years, I competed for Winston Churchill Middle School and Mira Loma High School in Sacramento, CA. In those years, Science Olympiad became the most important influence on my collegiate and career choices leading me to where I am today. I hope to contribute to Science Olympiad to further impose the competition's positive influence on other students to help them discover their passions.
