  bio: Hey, I’m Garrick, and I’m currently a sophomore at Stanford University interested in studying computer science, product design, or anything, really. In my spare time I jam on the ukelele, go on reddit, work as a theatre technician, and dabble in graphic design. I am excited to be working with the team at Golden Gate to inspire new generations of high school students to get excited about STEM!

- name: Neil Patil
  school: Computer Science, UT Austin 2020
  bio: Hello! I'm a LASA alum and was captain of LASA's Science Olympiad team during 2015 and 2016. I did build events, which means that most of my SciO memories involve soldering in a hotel room bathtub, getting gliders stuck in chandeliers, or getting kicked out of Wal-Mart at 1 AM (sometimes you gotta test Scrambler the night before...) SciO's been a pretty big part of my life (in both the good and bad ways), so I'm glad to be helping run this tournament and improve it for all of y'all.
  favEvents: Scrambler, Mission Possible

- name: Dusty Schroeder
  school: Assistant Professor of Geophysics, Stanford University
  bio: Dusty Schroeder is an assistant professor of geophysics in the School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences at Stanford University. He works on the fundamental problem of observing, understanding, and predicting the configuration and evolution of ice sheet boundary conditions using ice penetrating radar sounding data. Before coming to Stanford he worked as a radar systems engineer with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology on NASA’s Europa Clipper Mission.  Dusty is also a former Science Olympian competitor (Solon Middle School and High School between ’97 - 02), coach (LASA High School ’07 - ’14), national event supervisor (Astronomy ’03 - ’11, Reach for the Stars and Solar System ’12 – present), and national committee co-chair (Earth and Space Sciences ’15 – present).
