  school: Computer Science, UT Austin 2020
  bio: Hello! I'm a LASA alum and was captain of LASA's Science Olympiad team during 2015 and 2016. I did build events, which means that most of my SciO memories involve soldering in a hotel room bathtub, getting gliders stuck in chandeliers, or getting kicked out of Wal-Mart at 1 AM (sometimes you gotta test Scrambler the night before...) Science Olympiad has been a pretty big part of my life (in both the good and bad ways), so I'm glad to be helping run this tournament.

  bio: Hello world, I’m Grant, former SciOly captain at Valencia High! My SciOly adventure began at Kraemer Middle, and I gradually found a passion for build events at Valencia High (competed 6 years). I still remember the long hours I spent soldering wires, gluing bridge joints with impossible precision, and getting wright stuff planes stuck in the ceiling. I have also helped coach the Kraemer team for 4 years and helped coordinate the CA Inland Empire Regionals and invitationals in the OC region. Overall, my SciOly experience has been a blast and I look forward to continuing to work with students in the community!
