  school: Computer Science, UT Austin 2020
  bio: Hello! I'm a LASA alum and was captain of LASA's Science Olympiad team during 2015 and 2016. I did build events, which means that most of my SciO memories involve soldering in a hotel room bathtub, getting gliders stuck in chandeliers, or getting kicked out of Wal-Mart at 1 AM (sometimes you gotta test Scrambler the night before...) Science Olympiad has been a pretty big part of my life (in both the good and bad ways), so I'm glad to be helping run this tournament.
  favEvents: Scrambler, Mission Possible

  school: Berkeley 2021
  bio: Hi! I'm David, and I'm an alum from Mira Loma High school. Science Olympiad was a big part of my life, and I spent countless hours doing almost every build event, so I've had my fair share of all nighters and last minute runs to Home Depot. Even though Science Olympiad caused me sleep deprivation and a whole lotta stress, I loved every second of it, and I look forward to continuing my Sci Oly career as an event coordinator for Helicopters!

  school: Mathematics and Economics/Business Administration, Berkeley 2020
  bio: Hi, I'm Shaina, a graduate of Mira Loma High school.  After being asked to fill in for my school's SciOly B team at Regionals my junior year, I joined the the team as a senior and had the distinct pleasure of getting to compete at nationals in Cell biology and Protein Modeling.  After this great experience, I was thrilled to write the Microbe Mission test at GGSO last year, and am really excited to be participating again this year.
  favEvent: Cell biology
  funFact: My second memory is of the SF Giants losing the World Series in 2002, so I guess you could say I'm passionate about baseball.

  school: Computer Science and Aerospace Engineering, Stanford 2019
  bio: Hey, I'm Nick! I've had the joy of competing in Science Olympiad for 3 years at Troy High school in Fullerton, CA, during which I got to be a part of two Nationals-winning teams. I captained the team in my senior year and enjoyed competing in my favorite events It's About Time and Compound Machines, along with some more frustrating/hellish events like Anatomy, MagLev (1st place at Nats, yay!), Experimental Design, and Bridges. 
  funFact: My MagLev car for Nationals 201 was made to work (at 2 am on the day of Nationals) with the help of a component salvaged from a Happy Meal toy.

- name: Varun Sudunagunta
  school: biological Basis of Behavior and Earth Science, University of Pennsylvania 2021
  bio: Hello, I’m Varun. I’m an alum and former captain of LASA. I’ve been involved with Science Olympiad for 7 years and the three years I spent in high school making enormous binders and staying up until 2 AM the night before a competition cramming, finishing binders, and taking tests were some of the most rewarding and defining moments of my high school experience. I’ve had the great honor of competing at Nationals three times and I'm excited to be able to write exams and improve the experience of current competitors. 
  favEvents: Fossils, Rocks and Minerals, Invasive Species, Anatomy and Physiology
  funFact: The majority of my Fossils binder was handwritten (I know it sounds odd, but it worked), so whenever I took it to competition it was always carried inside a small duffel bag to protect it from the elements.
