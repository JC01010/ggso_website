Golden Gate Science Olympiad is a non-profit organization led by Science Olympiad national-level medalists from Stanford and UC Berkeley. Our mission is to revolutionize the STEM experience for high school students nationwide. 

This winter, Golden Gate Science Olympiad will be hosting its inaugural invitational tournament. Our event is expected to bring together over 800 high school students, parents, and coaches from across the nation. Your company would be able to reach a wealth of STEM educators and young innovators. 

Similar ventures like the MIT Science Olympiad invitational and the Yale Invitational have brought together young minds with the potential to shape the future of science and engineering. We would love to work with your organization to explore how talent can inspire an ongoing spirit of innovation. 

As a sponsor, your company will be recognized throughout the invitational to over 800 of the nation's brightest future scientists and engineers, with various perks such as event prizes and distribution of marketing materials. As Stanford University and UC Berkeley are two of the most recognizable and reputable West-Coast universities, your sponsorship will have a lasting impact across the two campuses. Sponsorships help support running the competition â€“ from renting rooms to hiring test writers to providing adequate transportation. Our partnership can make critical STEM education more accessible to everyone, bring necessary extracurricular opportunities to underserved school districts, and foster our vision to provide opportunities for growth in science-related fields to the top-tier of high school students. 

If your organization would like to help contribute to our cause, please contact us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com

Golden Gate Science Olympiad would like to thank our sponsors for making this happen!
