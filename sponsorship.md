Bioengineering applies engineering principles and practices to living things, to solve some of the most challenging problems that face our world today. The Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley seeks to define the new discipline of bioengineering by concentrating on cutting-edge research and the training of advanced undergraduate and graduate students to be the next leaders in the field. Consistently ranked in the Top 10 according to US News & World Report, Bioengineering at Berkeley draws on the talents of a diverse group of outstanding faculty, and upon the long history of interdisciplinary bioengineering research at UC Berkeley. The department has programs at the undergraduate, professional master, and doctoral levels.

Stanford ChEM-H is a new interdisciplinary institute focused on connecting Chemistry, Engineering, and Medicine for Human Health. The institute is a joint venture of the Schools of Medicine, Engineering, and Humanities and Sciences. The proximity of world-class biologists, chemists, engineers, and clinicians at Stanford presents a unique opportunity to study human biology at a molecular level, to translate this knowledge into groundbreaking products and services that promote healthy living, and to educate a new cadre of “physician-scientist-engineers” who will lead a rapidly evolving industry.
